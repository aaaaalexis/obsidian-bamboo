# Bamboo

Bamboo improves Obsidian editor word boundaries for CJK text (Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul).

## What it does

- CJK-aware word selection
- Preserves Obsidian default behavior for non-CJK text
- Zero configuration (works immediately when enabled)

## Disclaimer

This plugin was built entirely with **Claude Sonnet 4.6** and **GPT-5.3-Codex**.
